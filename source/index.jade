        p #[strong Avalanche UK] is a team of parents and adult gamers who've found mutual friendship through #[strong Destiny] on #[strong Xbox One], our goal is to play the games we love with people who share our ethics. While fun is our main goal we also try to help new members rank up and progress as much as we can. So if you're an adult with or without commitments we could be the clan for you.

              p Finally getting the last piece of raid armour you've been missing, that feels good. Finding a group that'll run the raid with you three times a week until you finally get it, that's golden.
